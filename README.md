Wedding apparel and venue design are critical components of generating lasting memories. Our **"B💍NDL🌼CK"** virtual wedding planning system with augmented reality provides a one-of-a-kind experience. Couples may select personalized apparel, try it on, and make an informed choice for their wedding day. This approach also provides grooms with assistance in selecting the best attire for their body type. The couple's design selections set the tone for these unforgettable moments, and we incorporate traditional features such as the Poruwa ritual. This procedure is made easier and more enjoyable by augmented reality and 3D modeling.

## About Us

We are an enthusiastic group of final-year Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) (https://www.sliit.lk/) students starting on an exciting adventure in the realms of technology and innovation. Our objective is to bring our study project to life, and we're excited to talk with you about it.

Our project represents the final chapter of our academic experience at SLIIT. We've spent years honing our talents in information technology, research, and invention, preparing us for this huge task. We are delighted to bridge the gap between academics and real-world applications as we stand on the edge of the future.

We dedicated our hearts and minds to resulting in a cutting-edge solution for our 4th-year final project. We feel that our project B💍NDL🌼CK has the potential to change the way you think about dreamed weddings based on technology.
